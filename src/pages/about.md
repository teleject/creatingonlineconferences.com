[Ari Stiles](#heading-ari-stiles) and [Christopher Schmitt](#heading-christopher-schmitt) have produced online events (along with on-site events) for close to a decade.

We run technically sound experiences while trying to bridge the digital gap to create engaging experiences for speakers to shine, audiences to learn, and sponsors to return.

In short, we loved online event production before it was necessary.

## Passionate About Online Events

Online events are:

- **Ecological and sustainable**. Ultimately, fewer resources are used to produce events online.
- **Inclusive**. Attendees who are unable to travel—because of physical, financial, or schedule constraints—can participate in online events and network with like-minded attendees.
- **Convenient**. No travel, no hotel reservations, no worries about meal planning for hundreds of attendees—organizers and attendees are free to focus on the content, not the hassle.

And now they are...

- **A Safe Alternative**. Everyone can participate in a shared experience while still under quarantine.

## Ari Stiles

**Ari Stiles** manages book production and other print projects for Smashing Media. Until very recently, she was an awesome conference organizer. Ari uses her penchant for design, writing, research, and organization to foster meaningful communication and create sustainable work spaces.

Previously, she worked at Environments for Humans, SXSW Interactive, University of Texas at Austin.

## Christopher Schmitt

Christopher Schmitt is an award-winning web designer who has been working in the medium for over twenty years.

He has a Masters in Communication for Interactive and New Communication Technologies, and is the author of many books including <cite>CSS Cookbook</cite> and <cite>Designing Web and Mobile Graphics</cite>.

Christopher was featured in <cite>[What Comes Next is the Future](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6036786/)</cite>, a documentary of the web: how it came to be, where it’s been, and where it’s going – as told by the people who build it.

Christopher is always looking for ways to help educate and empower people about web publishing and technology culture.
