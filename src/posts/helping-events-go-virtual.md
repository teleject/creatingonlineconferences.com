Since we used to run online event for close to a decade, several conference organizers and friends have contacted [Ari Stiles](https://twitter.com/ari4nne) and I over the past couple of weeks for insights.

Many organizers are finding the need to move into the online space and do it quickly because of world-wide quarantine measures. We realized we were saying a lot of the same things in these meetings, so we thought maybe we should share what we know online in the coming days and weeks.

## Starting a Blog

So, I decided to blog about our experiences!

Most of the content you will see here is adapted from years of tech conference production experience. We had to create a lot of process documentation along the way!

As we find time to dig through our process documents, checklists, and other materials, weâ€™ll clean it up and share it here.

## Want to Talk to Someone?

If you are traditional, face-to-face, or onsite conference or maybe you would like to start hosting online events, [let me know](/contact/).

I have almost a decade experience producing and hosting online events and love it when people come together to learn and engage!
