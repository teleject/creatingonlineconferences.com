Several conferences have contacted us over the past couple of weeks.

Many are having to move into the online space and do it quickly because of worldwide quarantine measures. We realized we were saying a lot of the same things in these meetings, so we thought maybe we should share what we know online in the coming days and weeks.

## Starting a Blog

So, we decided to blog about our experiences! 

Most of the content you will see here is adapted from years of tech conference production experience. We had to create a lot of process documentation along the way!

As we find time to dig through our process documents, checklists, and other materials, weâ€™ll clean it up and share it here.

## Want to Talk to Someone?

If you are traditional, face-to-face, or onsite conference or maybe you would like to start hosting online events, let us know. 

We have almost a decade experience producing and hosting online events and love it when people come together to learn and engage!
