One of the core tenets of conferences is education. Attendees are there to learn, but sometimes a 30 or 60-minute session is not enough time to answer everyone's questions. 

When finished delivering your presentation, <strong>go the extra mile</strong> by:

## Taking Questions 
 
When you are done speaking, and there's still time left for your talk, take time for a Q&amp;A session.

## Sticking Around in the Chat

Depending on how your video platform is structured, the conference chat window will still be open for attendees to see after speaking. If so, let attendees know that you can answer questions there once your presentation time is officially over.

## Reaching Out in Social Media, Email

After the event is over, make sure to let attendees know that further discussion can take place on Twitter, Facebook, your blog post comments, or through email. Whatever method you feel comfortable with â€“ make sure people can readily reach out to you.

Your attendees appreciate will appreciate the follow-up, and organizers will see that you are willing to go the extra mile.
