One of the core tenets of conferences is education. Speakers are there to learn, but sometimes a 30 or 60-minute session is not enough time to answer everyone's questions. 

When finished delivering your presentation, go the extra mile.

When times runs out on your speaking slot, continue to answer questions. 

Depending on how your video platform is structured, the conference chat window will still be open for attendees to see after speaking. If so, let attendees know that you can answer questions there once you are done.

After the event is over, make sure to let attendees that further discussion can take place on Twitter, Facebook, your blog post comments, or through email. Whatever method you feel comfortable with.

Your attendees appreciate it when you follow-up.
