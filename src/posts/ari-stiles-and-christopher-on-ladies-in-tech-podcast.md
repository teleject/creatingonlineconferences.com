Founded and hosted by Jenn Lukas and Val Head, the Ladies in Tech serves to help and encourage women to promote themselves in web and tech fields.

Taking you behind the scenes of conference organizing in this featured episode, Ari and Christopher talk about some of the differences that youâ€™ll encounter in preparing and speaking at an online conference. 

We also share information about CSS Dev Conference, a conference taking place in New Orleans this October and the call for speakers is open right now.
