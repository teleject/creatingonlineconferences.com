For online presentations, I am not a fan of [open-ended questions](/do-not-ask-open-ended-questions/). Does not mean I think you should avoid interacting with attendees? Far from it!

## Using Yes/No Questions

I want speakers to avoid the awkwardness and confusion that comes from waiting for replies from an online audience. 

One way to do that is to _ask closed-ended questions_:  questions that require a simple "yes" or "no." Through these types of general questions, feedback is more immediate. 

To make sure attendees know it's a question, be sure to give a rising intonation at the end of the question.

## Using Choice Questions

If desired, I could move beyond a simple "yes" or "no" replies. I would need to make sure to give the audience a small answer set when asking the question.

For example:

* "Or you a teacher or a student?"
* "What is the best type of CSS positioning to use in this example: Absolute, Relative, Fixed, or Sticky?"
* "Which color is one that would be good for a color scheme about food: Green, Blue, Purple?"

Again, make sure there is a rising intonation at the end of the question -- and then say the list of potential answers clearly with distinct annunciation.
