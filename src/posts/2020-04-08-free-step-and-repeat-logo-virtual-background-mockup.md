Last time I [wrote about virtual backgrounds](/fun-backgrounds-for-zoom-green-screen-backgrounds/), it was about having fun with them. Thoses funny, pop-culture backgrounds can make meetings a little bit more interesting. However, what if one wants to present a more professional image when delivering a talk or hosting an online event – perhaps a cool or fun virtual background might not be 100% appropriate?

Well, let's talk about the step and repeat banner!

A **step and repeat banner** is usually for event photography or social media spots. They are printed with a repeating pattern so that brand logos or emblems are visible in photographs of the individuals standing in front of it. 

While more suited to photos, I think it's not too far of a stretch to bring it over to virtual backgrounds.

After writing about virtual backgrounds earlier in the week, I've done some experimenting with a step and repeat background with meetings – and, to be honest, I liked it so much, I thought I would create a Photoshop mockup for you to quickly make one.

## Instructions

</figure>

1. [Download `step-and-repeat-virtual-background.psd` file](https://GitHub.com/teleject/step-and-repeat-virtual-background/archive/master.zip) from the [GitHub project](https://github.com/teleject/step-and-repeat-virtual-background) and open the PSD open in Photoshop.
2. Add your logo: Within the "Place Logo in Here" layer folder, double-click the Smart Layer, copy-and-paste your logo onto a new layer, hide the previous logo layer, save, and export the image. The new background should be generated. 
3. Export the background in your file format of choice.
4. Set as your virtual background in video conference software. Use a green screen for better performance.

### Optional

1. Adjust the shadows: You can also turn on or off the shadow 
2. Add your own brand colors, if you want.


I made a simple animation that shows a few variations that are possible:

Will this be useful? I'm thinking of using this at my next online engagement. If you end up using it, [send me a screenshot](https://twitter.com/@teleject).
