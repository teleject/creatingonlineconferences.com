It's essential to make a fantastic first impression. 

People determine attributes of speakers based on what they see. All the ingredients of knowledge, preparation, delivery, and appearance are necessary to make a good impression.

While speaking online has allowed public speaking to come into cubicles and home offices, it's crucial when speaking to dress professionally.

It does not have to be the attire of a suit and tie, but your presentation outfit cannot be whatever you wear on a typical workday.

Whether your wearing yoga pants, sweat pants, shorts, pajamas, or whatever, you want to make sure the outfit you wear is at least one step above what your attendees might be wearing. 

The key is toÂ _dress better than the audience_.
