The main building blocks of an online event are the ones most conference organizers know. However, what separates the most experienced or well-established conference from a ho-hum conference is being successful at what I call _The In-Betweens_. 

While solving the logistics of the big items such as picking event date, tickets, online platform, and speakers, what's often _not_ discussed is what happens between those moments of an online event when nothing happens:

* Attendees waiting for the start of an event
* The moment immediately following an event, when people have not signed off yet?
* A scheduled intermission
* An unscheduled moments: 
  * such as a technical mishap 
  * or a speaker ends their talk earlier than expected.

Think about how these moments should be handled:

* What should be showing on the screen?
* What should attendees be hearing?
* Should attendees be engaging with chat, filling out a form, etc.?

Keep in mind how an attendee would appreciate [wayfinding](/wayfinding-for-virtual-attendees/) in these moments.

By being mindful of the In-Betweens, your attendee satisfaction from your online will soar.
