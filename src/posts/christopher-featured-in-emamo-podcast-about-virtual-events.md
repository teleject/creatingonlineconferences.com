Recently, I had the pleasure of talking with [Taylor McKnight](https://twitter.com/gtmcknight), Founder of Emamo. Emamo is an event planning software that takes a lot of pain of organizing and managing conferences of all types.

As the blog post mentions, Ari and I <q>dive deep into how they created a successful virtual conference series and the simple changes you can do to make your event more accessible and diversity friendly.</q>

The [54-minute podcast](https://emamo.com/blog/episode-10-virtual-conferences-and-their-hidden-benefit-inclusion/) offers a wide array of tips and insights. Find your copy where all quality podcasts are sold:
